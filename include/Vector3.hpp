	Description:	A small vector 3 implementation made in order to practice using SSE intrinsics and other facilities.
					This is by no means meant to replace or be used in lieu of libraries like GLM, it is simply made to gain familiarity
					with the intel SIMD extensions.
					Must be compiled using c++17 with a compiler that supports intel SIMD intrinsics.
